# AI Usage Log

Required deliverable. Kept as the work happens, not reconstructed at the end. Records where AI
helped, where it misled, and where it was overridden.

## Tools

- **Claude Code** (Opus 5) — primary development agent: requirements synthesis, spec-kit driving,
  implementation, review.
- **GitHub spec-kit** 1.1.1.dev0 with the Claude Code integration — `/speckit-constitution`,
  `/speckit-specify`, `/speckit-plan`, `/speckit-tasks`, `/speckit-implement`. Artifacts in
  `specs/001-binary-outcome-markets/`.

## Log

### 2026-10-05 — Requirements intake

Claude read the Gauntlet portal project page and the Peak6 partner description directly in a
browser, then downloaded the attached `Gauntlet Project - Meridian.pdf` and read all 8 pages.
Merged both sources into `docs/PRD.md` with numbered requirements FR-1…FR-10.

*Useful:* the PDF carries substantially more than the portal summary — the at-or-above tie rule,
the one-book/four-trade-path model, strike deduplication, and the devnet requirement all appear
only there. Reading both and reconciling them caught detail a single-source pass would have missed.

*Overridden:* nothing yet.

### 2026-10-05 — Architecture decisions

The four opening decisions (chain, oracle, order book, scope) were put to a human rather than
assumed, because each materially changes the work and each is explicitly graded as "justify your
choice". Decisions and reasoning recorded in `DECISIONS.md` §3–6.

*Human judgment applied:* the order book choice was deliberately **not** settled up front. Rather
than defaulting to the more impressive-sounding option, it was deferred behind a time-boxed spike
to verify Phoenix devnet availability first — the constraint that actually decides it. The spec was
then written to be implementation-neutral on that point so it survives either outcome.

### 2026-10-05 — Constitution and spec

`/speckit-constitution` produced `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v1.0.0 with seven principles.
`/speckit-specify` produced `specs/001-binary-outcome-markets/spec.md` plus its quality checklist.

*Useful:* the spec-kit quality checklist caught the right question about whether the open order
book decision should be a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker. It should not — it is an implementation
decision, not a requirements ambiguity — so it was recorded in Assumptions and the requirements
written as behaviour instead.

*Pruned:* generated scaffolding was rewritten rather than filled in. The spec template's five
principle slots were expanded to seven, and placeholder user stories replaced with the seven real
journeys.
